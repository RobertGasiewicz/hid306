        The Internet of Things, or IoT, is all about data from
        connected devices.  Millions of consumer and industrial
        devices drive IoT growth and challenge with data volume and
        variety. Big Data Analytics helps combing through these high
        volumes of complex IoT data into meaningful business insights.

        The Deep Learning is unique in machine learning algorithms to
        analyze supervised and unsupervised datasets. Big Data
        challenges like high volumes, multi-dimensionality and feature
        engineering are well addressed using Deep Learning
        algorithms. Deep Leaning, with edge and distributed mesh
        computing, is best suited to handle IoT Analytics of millions
        of sensors producing petabytes of time-series data.

        Apply exploratory data analysis and linear regression, a 
        supervised machine learning algorithm, to predict Sale Prices 
        of list of homes found in the sample test data using training 
        data having Sale Prices in the neighborhood area. Compare the 
        predicted model and results with various other 
        supervised algorithms. Two sample data sets are given with 
        79 attributes describing various aspects of the residential 
        homes in Ames and Iowa cities. Training data set contains 
        Sale Price of the homes, using the training data set, 
        how accurately we can predict Sale Prices of the homes in the 
        test data set using thorough exploratory data analysis.
