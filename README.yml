        The Internet of Things, or IoT, is all about data from 
        connected devices. Millions of consumer and industrial 
        devices drive IoT growth and challenge  with data
        volume and variety. Big Data Analytics helps combing 
        through these high volumes of complex IoT data into 
        meaningful business insights.
